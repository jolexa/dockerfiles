# dockerfiles

Personal collection of utilities. I'm happy to look at a PR's if someone else
would like to use a certain utility as well.

All commits are processed via
[aws-codebuild-dockerhub](https://github.com/jolexa/aws-codebuild-dockerhub) and
then pushed to [Docker Hub /jolexa](https://hub.docker.com/u/jolexa/) in a repo
named like the directory. eg, `docker pull jolexa/awscli`
